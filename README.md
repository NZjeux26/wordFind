# wordFind

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks&t=11s

Aim:
Given a random set of six letters, how fast can i find and print all the possible works containing only those letters be printed.

I found a text doc with 460k english words. In the video the fasest runtimes used bitmasking to do the compares, my aim is to do the same.

NO AI help.
