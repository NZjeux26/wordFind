# wordFind

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks&t=11s

Aim:
Given a random set of six letters, how fast can I find and print all the possible works containing only those letters (may include doubles of said letters or be smaller or larger than six letters)

I found a text doc with 460k English words. Using a nested for loop (O(n^2)). This was the method i came up with, though later i did think of a hashmap but i wanted something that i did.

NO AI help.

PS also working on a Perl version for learning Perl which is included.
